print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\nHow I wonder what you are!\nUp above the world so high,\nLike a diamond in the sky.\n\nWhen the blazing sun is gone,\nWhen he nothing shines upon,\nThen you show your little light,\nTwinkle, twinkle, all the night.\n\nThen the trav'ller in the dark,\nThanks you for your tiny spark,\nHe could not see which way to go\nIf you did not twinkle so.\n\nIn the dark blue sky you keep,\nAnd often thro' my curtains peep,\nFor you never shut your eye,\nTill the sun is in the sky.\n\n'Tis your bright and tiny spark,\nLights the trav'ller in the dark,\nTho' I know not what you are,\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star.")
